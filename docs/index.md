## Who Am I?
### _Nan Yar_

_All living beings desire to be happy always, withouth any misery. In everyone there is observed supreme love for onself.
And happiness alone is the cause of love. In order therefore, to gain that happiness which is one's nature and which is
experienced in the state of deep sleep, where there is no mind, one should know oneself. To achieve this, the Path of Knowledge,
the enquiry in the form of "Who am I?", is the principal means._
