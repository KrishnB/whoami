#### What is the nature of the Self?

_What exists in truth is the Self alone. The world, the individual soul and God are appearances in it, like silver in mother-of-pearl; these three appear at hte same time and disappear at the same time._

_The self is that where there is qbsolutely no 'I' -thought. That is called 'Silence'. The Self itself is the world; the Self itself is 'I'; the Self itself is God; all is Siva, the Self._
