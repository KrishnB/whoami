#### Is there no difference between waking and dream?

_Waking is long and dream short; other than this there is no difference. Jus t as waking happenings seem real while awake, so do those in a dream while dreaming.
In dream the mind takes on another body. In both waking and dream states thoughts, names and forms occur simultaneously._
