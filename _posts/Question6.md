#### Why?

_The seer and the object seen are like the rope and the snake. Just as the knowledge of the rope which is the substratum will not arise unless the false knowledge of the illusory serpant goes, so the realization of the Self which is the substratum will not be gained unless the belief that the world is real is removed._

[_When will the world which is the object seen be removed?_](Question7.md)
